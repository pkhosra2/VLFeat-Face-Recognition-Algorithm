# VLFeat SVM-Face-Recognition-Algorithm
This purpose of this algorithm is to use the VLfeat library to distinguish between an image with a face and an image without a face using the built in Support Vecotr Machine Algorithm in the VLFet Library.

## Introduction

The VLFeat library is a popular computer vision library specializing in image understanding and local features extraction and matching. Algorithms include Fisher Vector, VLAD, SIFT, MSER, k-means, hierarchical k-means, agglomerative information bottleneck, SLIC superpixels, quick shift superpixels, large scale SVM training, and many others.

## Datasets

For this project we will be working twith two datasets:

1. image_notefaces 
2. cropped_training_images_faces

Both of which we can find in our repository above
